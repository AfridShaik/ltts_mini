# Requirements
## Introduction
 * When I was in college, we had a lot of problems calculating internal marks and external marks for our mid and weekly test exams because one student uses one logic while another uses another without knowing which logic to use, and some students use the correct logic but something goes wrong during calculations, so I decided to make a software that can measure the students marks and add some extra features like calculating their CGPA, Percentage etc
 * In this project, we will generate a report for the student based on their information and grades to determine whether or not they passed the semester exams.

### Benefits
Users will measure their grades before and after exams and strive for high grades.
  

### Explanation:
* Student Report:
    * Create a comprehensive personal report for each student.
    * Students should save their personal information in a text file.
    * Student can calculate their internal marks.
    * Students should figure out their external grades.


# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Students can use this to measure their grades to determine whether or not they completed the semester.

## What:
* Student can calculate their internals and external marks

## When:
* If a student wants to know how well he did this semester, he should look at his grades.

## Where:
* Since a student needs to do well in college, he can measure his grades ahead of time and analyse how to pass the semester exams.

## How:
* Calculating their marks manually for each subject would be a time-consuming operation, and if anything goes wrong, the whole process will have to be repeated from the beginning..
